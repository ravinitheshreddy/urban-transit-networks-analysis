\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

With increasing urbanisation and more than half of the world's population living in cities, public transport forms a critical part of the city's infrastructure \cite{World_Bank_cities_2023}. Analysing public transport systems in cities is essential for improving accessibility, reducing congestion and guiding urban planning apart from the ecological and social benefits.

Transportation systems are natural graphs/networks in a geographic space with stops as nodes and connectivity between the nodes as edges. Each mode of transport (roads, rail, air, water) can have its network. The application of graph theory to transport systems is not a new phenomenon. The first problem that laid the road to graph theory \cite{Barabási_2016} - Seven Bridges of Königsberg - is a type of transport network. Analysing transport systems enable optimising efficiency, enhancing safety and security, mitigating environmental impact, supporting urban planning, and planning for the future.

A network model of the transport system provides a visual representation that aids in understanding their overall structure and connectivity. In addition, network analysis methods enable connectivity analysis, performance evaluation, route planning and modelling. Such studies give a deeper understanding of the system's infrastructure, efficiency, promote data-driven decision making and provide evidence for optimising and improving transport systems.

In the above-given context, this project studies the transportation network of 25 cities made available in \textbf{A collection of public transport network data sets for 25 cities} \cite{rainer_kujala_2018_1186215}. Specifically, the project examines: \\
\textbf{1:} How do the topological properties of public transport networks differ across different cities and compare in terms of connectivity?
\textbf{2:} Which public transport stops are the most important in each city based on their centrality measures? 
\textbf{3:} Whether node features can predict directed edges between them?

The rest of the report's organisation is as follows: The next section describes the data and pre-processing steps. Sections 3 and 4 present the exploration and exploitation analysis of the data and the results. The last section presents conclusions and limitations.

\section{Dataset and Pre-processing}
\label{dataset}

\subsection{Dataset}
As the title describes \cite{rainer_kujala_2018_1186215}, this data is a collection of the transport network of 25 cities. The following cities were part of the collection: \textit{Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne} and \textit{Sydney} from Australia (Oceania); \textit{Belfast} and \textit{Dublin} from Northern Ireland and Ireland; \textit{Berlin} from Germany; \textit{Bordeaux, Grenoble, Nantes, Paris, Rennes} and \textit{Toulouse} from France; \textit{Helsinki, Kuopio} and \textit{Turku} from Finland; \textit{Palermo, Rome} and \textit{Venice} from Italy; \textit{Lisbon} from Portugal; \textit{Prague} from Czech Republic; \textit{Luxembourg} (Europe); \textit{Detroit} from the United States of American and \textit{Winnipeg} from Canada (North America).

The collection provides multiple CSV and GEOJSON files for each city. Among those files, for each city, the \textit{networks\_nodes.csv }and \textit{network\_combined.csv }contain the information on the nodes and the edges, respectively. The former file contains information about the nodes (stops) - the Id, latitude, longitude and name. The latter file contains information about the edges (routes) such as the start node, to node, the straight line distance, the average duration between the stops, the number of times a public transport vehicle passes through that stop in an hour and the route type. The route type can be one of the following seven types: tram, subway, rail, bus, ferry, cablecar, gondola and funicular. This project uses a MultiDiGraph to represent the transport network of each city as there are different edges for different modes of transport, and each edge has a start and an end node.

\subsection{Pre-processing}
Initial examination showed three issues in the data. First, there were nodes with different IDs but the same name. Second, in some situations, nodes close to each other had different IDs - they were stops near big stations or where each platform had a different name. Lastly, there were some self-loops in the edge data, and there was no relevant information either on the city's transport website or in the data descriptor paper about self-loops. These issues could be due to the lack of standards in naming the stops (some cities having one name for an entire station or naming up to platform level) and artefacts of the spatial filtering performed by the creators of the dataset. Hence the pre-processing involved merging nodes with the same name and retaining the node with the smallest node Id. In the second step, remove edges with the same start and end node. As merging based on geographic distance could lead to contradictions with ground reality, the second issue out of the three remained unresolved.

\section{Network Analysis}
\label{analysis}

\subsection{Exploration}
\label{exploration}
The part of the project performs exploratory data analysis on the transport network of each city to gain an understanding of the dataset. Among the seven possible modes of transport described in the dataset, no city has networks of funiculars and gondolas, and only one city (Prague) has a cable car network with three stops. While all the cities have a bus network, 14 have a tram network,  12 have a rail network and ferry and subway networks are present in 8 each. Figure 1 shows the density of each mode of transport except for not strongly connected ones. The density of bus networks is very low compared to other networks implying fewer connections between stops, which makes travel difficult between different locations within the network. However, buses might provide last-mile connectivity and go around shorter distances in a limited geographical area. The rail network follows the bus with ten times more density. Nevertheless, it still falls between 0.003 and an outlier value of 0.7. The outlier is the Canberra rail network with three nodes and four edges. The tram network has the third lowest density varying between 0.001 and 0.1. The subway networks have the second highest density roughly ten times less than that of the ferry network (with the highest density values lying in the range of 0.02 and 0.7). These results are expected as the transport networks do not connect all stops with the majority of the other stops.

Figures 2 and 3 show the in-degree and the out-degree distributions for various modes of transport in each city. The in-degree distribution follows a very similar pattern to the out-degree distribution. The distributions highlight many nodes with low degrees and a few with high degrees, making it difficult to model them by a random network model. With a median of an average degree of 2.03, each stop connects with two others. All the cities have around 1 minute of median travel time in the complete network except Detroit and Winnipeg, where it is half a minute and Paris and Prague, where it is nearly 2 minutes. However, on the individual transport mode level, people in Paris, Toulouse and Grenoble spend 2 minutes between two stops on average on the tram, and others spend around a minute to a minute and a half. For the subways, Helsinki has the highest time of 1.9 minutes. People in Canberra spend 20 minutes between rail stations, followed by distantly second Luxembourg at 3.87 minutes. The average travel time between stops on the bus is around one minute. Only eight cities have ferries, and the average travel time between their piers is highest in Bordeaux (9.5 minutes), followed by Sydney (8.9 minutes), and only 2 minutes in Prague. Lastly, only Prague has a cable car with three nodes and an average duration of 1.5 minutes between the stops.

The Betweenness Centrality (BC) of the nodes calculated using the average duration between stops captures the relative importance of transfer nodes within the network. The results support the hypothesis that the nodes with the highest BC in the city network represent the transit stations between different modes of transport. Luxembourg, Gare Centrale in Luxembourg or S+U Gesundbrunnen Bhf (Berlin) in Berlin and Chatelet les Halles in Paris are a few examples that are either big transit stops or next to very busy ones. Some stations, such as those in Berlin's ferry network with three routes between two different nodes each, have zero centrality because the network has very few or disconnected nodes. Figure 4 visualises the network in Winnipeg with nodes colour coded using the BC values. The nodes in yellow have the highest BC and are close to the city centre. Figure 5 visualises the Berlin network, and nodes on the city's periphery and centre have the highest BC. Further examination revealed that they are the transit stations between different lines of the Berlin S-Bahn, regional and long-distance trains of the German train network. In a no longer online document, German's national rail company categorises six stations among the top ten nodes of Berlin, having the highest BC, as category 1 and 2 stations. These highly classified stations have heavy and efficient infrastructure, are frequented heavily and serve as critical transfer points.

For transport networks, Average Clustering Coefficient (ACC) can provide insight into the local connectivity of the network and the extent to which transportation nodes are connected. A high average clustering coefficient indicates that the nodes tend to be densely connected, forming clusters or hubs. A low average clustering coefficient could imply that transportation nodes in the network are more sparsely connected, potentially leading to longer travel times or more complicated travel routes for travellers. In the 25 cities, almost all modes have low clustering coefficients, some even zero, indicating disconnected components like the Berlin ferry. The rail and bus modes have higher ACC, suggesting that they are better connected than the other modes of transport. Cities have one (or rarely two) modes with a high clustering coefficient.

Another parameter to measure the connectivity is the possibility of changing between different modes of transport, studied through the types of incoming and outgoing edges of a node. Figure 6 shows the number of different transport modes at a stop on the x-axis and the number of nodes on the y-axis. A city can be well-connected if there are more opportunities to switch between different modes of transport. In other words, a higher number of nodes with multiple transportation options passing through them indicates a well-connected transport network. However, this analysis does not fully apply to cities like Belfast, Detroit, Kuopio, Palermo, Turku, and Winnipeg, as they only have bus transport. For most cities, the distribution is skewed to the left, suggesting that most nodes accommodate only one mode. These cities have less interconnected transport networks, resulting in congestion at central stations where many people need to switch public transport vehicles. Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Dublin, and Sydney belong to this category, although Adelaide and Sydney have three and four modes of transport, respectively. The second category comprises cities with moderately connected networks, such as Bordeaux, Helsinki, Lisbon, Melbourne, Paris, and Rome. In these cities, a relatively higher number of nodes connect with more than one or two modes of transport. Lastly, the well-connected cities include Berlin, Grenoble, Luxembourg, Nantes, Prague, Rennes, Toulouse, and Venice. These cities have a higher proportion of nodes connecting to diverse transportation modes allowing passengers to disperse across multiple stations, facilitating ease of movement. It's important to note that this analysis solely focuses on theoretical connectivity and does not account for factors like city area, population, or topography.

Lastly, the networks were modelled using the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model, which typically starts with an initial set of nodes and uses both growth and preferential attachment in developing the network. The results show that the BA model provides a reasonable approximation to model the nature of the degree distribution of the nodes in the network. For cities with a large number of nodes and edges, like Paris and Sydney, there is a steeper reduction in the number of nodes with the increase in the node degree. For smaller ones like Prague and Winnipeg, the decline is more gradual. Transport networks for larger cities may have a higher preferential attachment factor that is superlinear in terms of node degree. The BA model that applies a linear preferential attachment has a less steep reduction in the number of nodes for higher degrees.

% \section{Electronic Submission}
% \label{submission}

% Submission to ICML 2023 will be entirely electronic, via a web site
% (not email). Information about the submission process and \LaTeX\ templates
% are available on the conference web site at:
% \begin{center}
% \textbf{\texttt{http://icml.cc/}}
% \end{center}

% The guidelines below will be enforced for initial submissions and
% camera-ready copies. Here is a brief summary:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Submissions must be in PDF\@. 
% \item \textbf{New to this year}: If your paper has appendices, submit the appendix together with the main body and the references \textbf{as a single file}. Reviewers will not look for appendices as a separate PDF file. So if you submit such an extra file, reviewers will very likely miss it.
% \item Page limit: The main body of the paper has to be fitted to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices; the space for the latter two is not limited. For the final version of the paper, authors can add one extra page to the main body.
% \item \textbf{Do not include author information or acknowledgements} in your
%     initial submission.
% \item Your paper should be in \textbf{10 point Times font}.
% \item Make sure your PDF file only uses Type-1 fonts.
% \item Place figure captions \emph{under} the figure (and omit titles from inside
%     the graphic file itself). Place table captions \emph{over} the table.
% \item References must include page numbers whenever possible and be as complete
%     as possible. Place multiple citations in chronological order.
% \item Do not alter the style template; in particular, do not compress the paper
%     format by reducing the vertical spaces.
% \item Keep your abstract brief and self-contained, one paragraph and roughly
%     4--6 sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the
%     camera-ready phase. The title should have content words capitalized.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Submitting Papers}

% \textbf{Paper Deadline:} The deadline for paper submission that is
% advertised on the conference website is strict. If your full,
% anonymized, submission does not reach us on time, it will not be
% considered for publication. 

% \textbf{Anonymous Submission:} ICML uses double-blind review: no identifying
% author information may appear on the title page or in the paper
% itself. \cref{author info} gives further details.

% \textbf{Simultaneous Submission:} ICML will not accept any paper which,
% at the time of submission, is under review for another conference or
% has already been published. This policy also applies to papers that
% overlap substantially in technical content with conference papers
% under review or previously published. ICML submissions must not be
% submitted to other conferences and journals during ICML's review
% period.
% %Authors may submit to ICML substantially different versions of journal papers
% %that are currently under review by the journal, but not yet accepted
% %at the time of submission.
% Informal publications, such as technical
% reports or papers in workshop proceedings which do not appear in
% print, do not fall under these restrictions.

% \medskip

% Authors must provide their manuscripts in \textbf{PDF} format.
% Furthermore, please make sure that files contain only embedded Type-1 fonts
% (e.g.,~using the program \texttt{pdffonts} in linux or using
% File/DocumentProperties/Fonts in Acrobat). Other fonts (like Type-3)
% might come from graphics files imported into the document.

% Authors using \textbf{Word} must convert their document to PDF\@. Most
% of the latest versions of Word have the facility to do this
% automatically. Submissions will not be accepted in Word format or any
% format other than PDF\@. Really. We're not joking. Don't send Word.

% Those who use \textbf{\LaTeX} should avoid including Type-3 fonts.
% Those using \texttt{latex} and \texttt{dvips} may need the following
% two commands:

% {\footnotesize
% \begin{verbatim}
% dvips -Ppdf -tletter -G0 -o paper.ps paper.dvi
% ps2pdf paper.ps
% \end{verbatim}}
% It is a zero following the ``-G'', which tells dvips to use
% the config.pdf file. Newer \TeX\ distributions don't always need this
% option.

% Using \texttt{pdflatex} rather than \texttt{latex}, often gives better
% results. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, and supports more
% advanced features in the \texttt{microtype} package.

% \textbf{Graphics files} should be a reasonable size, and included from
% an appropriate format. Use vector formats (.eps/.pdf) for plots,
% lossless bitmap formats (.png) for raster graphics with sharp lines, and
% jpeg for photo-like images.

% The style file uses the \texttt{hyperref} package to make clickable
% links in documents. If this causes problems for you, add
% \texttt{nohyperref} as one of the options to the \texttt{icml2023}
% usepackage statement.


% \subsection{Submitting Final Camera-Ready Copy}

% The final versions of papers accepted for publication should follow the
% same format and naming convention as initial submissions, except that
% author information (names and affiliations) should be given. See
% \cref{final author} for formatting instructions.

% The footnote, ``Preliminary work. Under review by the International
% Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute.'' must be
% modified to ``\textit{Proceedings of the
% $\mathit{40}^{th}$ International Conference on Machine Learning},
% Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, PMLR 202, 2023.
% Copyright 2023 by the author(s).''

% For those using the \textbf{\LaTeX} style file, this change (and others) is
% handled automatically by simply changing
% $\mathtt{\backslash usepackage\{icml2023\}}$ to
% $$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage[accepted]\{icml2023\}}$$
% Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the
% footnote on the first page of the document themselves.

% Camera-ready copies should have the title of the paper as running head
% on each page except the first one. The running title consists of a
% single line centered above a horizontal rule which is $1$~point thick.
% The running head should be centered, bold and in $9$~point type. The
% rule should be $10$~points above the main text. For those using the
% \textbf{\LaTeX} style file, the original title is automatically set as running
% head using the \texttt{fancyhdr} package which is included in the ICML
% 2023 style file package. In case that the original title exceeds the
% size restrictions, a shorter form can be supplied by using

% \verb|\icmltitlerunning{...}|

% just before $\mathtt{\backslash begin\{document\}}$.
% Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the header of the document themselves.

% \section{Format of the Paper}

% All submissions must follow the specified format.

% \subsection{Dimensions}




% The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns, with an
% overall width of 6.75~inches, height of 9.0~inches, and 0.25~inches
% between the columns. The left margin should be 0.75~inches and the top
% margin 1.0~inch (2.54~cm). The right and bottom margins will depend on
% whether you print on US letter or A4 paper, but all final versions
% must be produced for US letter size.
% Do not write anything on the margins.

% The paper body should be set in 10~point type with a vertical spacing
% of 11~points. Please use Times typeface throughout the text.

% \subsection{Title}

% The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
% between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
% between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
% first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
% case.

% \subsection{Author Information for Submission}
% \label{author info}

% ICML uses double-blind review, so author information must not appear. If
% you are using \LaTeX\/ and the \texttt{icml2023.sty} file, use
% \verb+\icmlauthor{...}+ to specify authors and \verb+\icmlaffiliation{...}+ to specify affiliations. (Read the TeX code used to produce this document for an example usage.) The author information
% will not be printed unless \texttt{accepted} is passed as an argument to the
% style file.
% Submissions that include the author information will not
% be reviewed.

% \subsubsection{Self-Citations}

% If you are citing published papers for which you are an author, refer
% to yourself in the third person. In particular, do not use phrases
% that reveal your identity (e.g., ``in previous work \cite{langley00}, we
% have shown \ldots'').

% Do not anonymize citations in the reference section. The only exception are manuscripts that are
% not yet published (e.g., under submission). If you choose to refer to
% such unpublished manuscripts \cite{anonymous}, anonymized copies have
% to be submitted
% as Supplementary Material via CMT\@. However, keep in mind that an ICML
% paper should be self contained and should contain sufficient detail
% for the reviewers to evaluate the work. In particular, reviewers are
% not required to look at the Supplementary Material when writing their
% review (they are not required to look at more than the first $8$ pages of the submitted document).

% \subsubsection{Camera-Ready Author Information}
% \label{final author}

% If a paper is accepted, a final camera-ready copy must be prepared.
% %
% For camera-ready papers, author information should start 0.3~inches below the
% bottom rule surrounding the title. The authors' names should appear in 10~point
% bold type, in a row, separated by white space, and centered. Author names should
% not be broken across lines. Unbolded superscripted numbers, starting 1, should
% be used to refer to affiliations.

% Affiliations should be numbered in the order of appearance. A single footnote
% block of text should be used to list all the affiliations. (Academic
% affiliations should list Department, University, City, State/Region, Country.
% Similarly for industrial affiliations.)

% Each distinct affiliations should be listed once. If an author has multiple
% affiliations, multiple superscripts should be placed after the name, separated
% by thin spaces. If the authors would like to highlight equal contribution by
% multiple first authors, those authors should have an asterisk placed after their
% name in superscript, and the term ``\textsuperscript{*}Equal contribution"
% should be placed in the footnote block ahead of the list of affiliations. A
% list of corresponding authors and their emails (in the format Full Name
% \textless{}email@domain.com\textgreater{}) can follow the list of affiliations.
% Ideally only one or two names should be listed.

% A sample file with author names is included in the ICML2023 style file
% package. Turn on the \texttt{[accepted]} option to the stylefile to
% see the names rendered. All of the guidelines above are implemented
% by the \LaTeX\ style file.

% \subsection{Abstract}

% The paper abstract should begin in the left column, 0.4~inches below the final
% address. The heading `Abstract' should be centered, bold, and in 11~point type.
% The abstract body should use 10~point type, with a vertical spacing of
% 11~points, and should be indented 0.25~inches more than normal on left-hand and
% right-hand margins. Insert 0.4~inches of blank space after the body. Keep your
% abstract brief and self-contained, limiting it to one paragraph and roughly 4--6
% sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the camera-ready phase.

% \subsection{Partitioning the Text}

% You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
% readers place a structure on the material and understand its
% contributions.

% \subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}

% Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
% type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
% before the heading and 0.15~inches after the heading.

% Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and set
% in 10~pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
% 0.2~inches of space before the heading and 0.13~inches afterward.

% Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and
% set in 10~pt small caps with the content words capitalized. Leave
% 0.18~inches of space before the heading and 0.1~inches after the
% heading.

% Please use no more than three levels of headings.

% \subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

% Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
% paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
% paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

% You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes
% should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
% information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper.
% Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
% relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
% column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
% with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
% appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
% but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

% \subsection{Figures}

% You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
% your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
% legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
% least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
% not appear on a gray background.

% Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
% form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
% that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
% figure; instead, the caption should serve this function.

% Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and caption
% \emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
% the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
% \cref{icml-historical}. The figure caption should be set in
% 9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
% case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
% bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
% (use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
% two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

% \subsection{Algorithms}

% If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
% environments to format pseudocode. These require
% the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
% algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.

% \subsection{Tables}

% You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
% figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
% However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
% 0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
% \cref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
% type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
% should be flush left.

% % Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% % above and below tabular lines.

% \begin{table}[t]
% \caption{Classification accuracies for naive Bayes and flexible
% Bayes on various data sets.}
% \label{sample-table}
% \vskip 0.15in
% \begin{center}
% \begin{small}
% \begin{sc}
% \begin{tabular}{lcccr}
% \toprule
% Data set & Naive & Flexible & Better? \\
% \midrule
% Breast    & 95.9$\pm$ 0.2& 96.7$\pm$ 0.2& $\surd$ \\
% Cleveland & 83.3$\pm$ 0.6& 80.0$\pm$ 0.6& $\times$\\
% Glass2    & 61.9$\pm$ 1.4& 83.8$\pm$ 0.7& $\surd$ \\
% Credit    & 74.8$\pm$ 0.5& 78.3$\pm$ 0.6&         \\
% Horse     & 73.3$\pm$ 0.9& 69.7$\pm$ 1.0& $\times$\\
% Meta      & 67.1$\pm$ 0.6& 76.5$\pm$ 0.5& $\surd$ \\
% Pima      & 75.1$\pm$ 0.6& 73.9$\pm$ 0.5&         \\
% Vehicle   & 44.9$\pm$ 0.6& 61.5$\pm$ 0.4& $\surd$ \\
% \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{sc}
% \end{small}
% \end{center}
% \vskip -0.1in
% \end{table}

% Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
% Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
% row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
% wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
% top or bottom of the page.

% \subsection{Theorems and such}
% The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
% \begin{definition}
% \label{def:inj}
% A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
% \end{definition}
% Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
% \begin{proposition}
% If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
% the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof} 
% Left as an exercise to the reader. 
% \end{proof}
% \cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
% \begin{lemma}
% \label{lem:usefullemma}
% For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{theorem}
% \label{thm:bigtheorem}
% If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
% \end{theorem}
% An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
% \begin{corollary}
% If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
% the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{assumption}
% The set $X$ is finite.
% \label{ass:xfinite}
% \end{assumption}
% \begin{remark}
% According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.
% \end{remark}

% \subsection{Citations and References}

% Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
% or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic
% facility, use \texttt{natbib.sty} and \texttt{icml2023.bst}
% included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

% Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
% year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
% the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
% pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
% reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
% comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
% semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
% construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
% listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

% Authors should cite their own work in the third person
% in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
% Please refer to \cref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
% cite your own papers.

% Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and use a
% hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush against the
% left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. The references at the
% end of this document give examples for journal articles \cite{Samuel59},
% conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books
% \cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, technical reports
% \cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}.

% Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
% single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
% references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
% earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
% information (e.g., page numbers).

% Please put some effort into making references complete, presentable, and
% consistent, e.g. use the actual current name of authors.
% If using bibtex, please protect capital letters of names and
% abbreviations in titles, for example, use \{B\}ayesian or \{L\}ipschitz
% in your .bib file.

% \section*{Accessibility}
% Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
% Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

% \section*{Software and Data}

% If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
% camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
% done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
% include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
% submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
% the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the CMT reviewing
% system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
% when writing their review.

% % Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% probably should) include acknowledgements. In this case, please
% place such acknowledgements in an unnumbered section at the
% end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
% who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas,
% and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial
% support.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
% \nocite{langley00}
